Darkcore
=======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/UdjinM6/darkcore.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/UdjinM6/darkcore)

A pure, powerful core for your POSQ project.

Darkcore is a complete, native interface to the Darkcoin network that was modified to work with the POSQ network for our purposes, and provides the core functionality needed to develop apps for POSQ.

Forked from Bitcore ([https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore)) and therefore has fully compatible API.
